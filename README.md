# Foundry Manager

This project is a basic foundry vtt manager:
It is intended to help non-tech users to manage their Foundry vtt instances: mainly launch them and stop them. The purpose is also to offer them basic file capabilities to create directories and to upload files.

It is not intended to be a complete file manager but a simplefile transfer tool.

It should also have a basic identity management system so that each user is connected and identified in the app.
